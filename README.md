## About forks
Forking a repository makes an exact copy another project that resides on your personal account. This acts as a connection between your own repo and the owner's repo. Additionally, this allows the owner to protect their own code by preventing users from pushing to it directly but still giving developers a way to contribute in a non-intrusive way. Forking is very common in open-source software development.

Forking is indeed a fundamental concept in open-source development, enabling collaboration and contribution while maintaining the integrity of the original project. It serves as a bridge between the original repository and individual developers' repositories, allowing them to work on their own versions without altering the original codebase directly.

This practice not only safeguards the original code but also provides a structured way for developers to propose changes. By forking a repository, developers can freely experiment with modifications, fixes, or new features in their own isolated environment. Once they are satisfied with the changes, they can propose them back to the original project through pull requests.

This model fosters a collaborative environment where contributions can be reviewed, discussed, and refined before being integrated into the main project. It also promotes transparency and accountability, as all changes are documented and subject to scrutiny by the community.

Overall, forking plays a crucial role in the distributed and decentralized nature of open-source development, empowering developers to innovate, collaborate, and collectively improve software projects.
